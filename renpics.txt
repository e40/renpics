"renpics" -- rename pictures

renpics can be used to rename jpg files based on exposure date and
time in the EXIF header.  The files are renamed to have the form:

   YYYYMMDD-hhmm-ssnn-xxxx.jpg

where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day, hh is the
hour, mm is the minute, ss is the second, nn is a sequence number used
only when more than one picture was taken in a given second, and xxxx
is the camera name.

Type "renpics" to see what command line arguments renpics accepts.

renpics is a Windows console app.  That is, it is meant to be run from
a command shell (command.com or cmd.exe).

Here is a bat file that I use to move files from a CF (CompactFlash)
card onto my hard drive:

   @echo off
   renpics -m -o c:/pictures/_TMP/ j:/
   pause

-m means `move' instead of `copy'.  `-o c:/pictures/_TMP/' is the
destination directory and j:/ is the source directory.  renpics looks
in all subdirectories of j:/ for all .jpg's.
